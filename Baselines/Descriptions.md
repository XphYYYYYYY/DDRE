## GSGNS
The implementation of the generalized skip-gram with negative sampling for signed networks.

## ROSE
\[Rose: Role-based signed network embedding\] provides a method to transform a directed signed network to an undirected unsigned network.
And then, many classical embedding methods with open-sourced code, such as Deepwalk and node2vec, can be used to learn representations.

We provid the implementation of the transformation. 

## NetMF
Though the authors have released their code, it is somewhat hard-to-use for us.
Fortunately, the core idea of NetMF is clear and simple, so we implemented NetMF following the paper.
